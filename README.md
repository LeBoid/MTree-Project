# Project: Multiway Search Tree (M-Tree)
## Overview
This project is a significant step in understanding data structures, specifically focusing on implementing a multiway search tree (M-Tree). The M-Tree is designed to store and efficiently manage sorted data while maintaining balanced tree properties. It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations by recursively splitting a sorted array and using the split values for tree navigation. This project is an integral part of the learning journey in data structures, equipping you with practical skills for your future career.

## Features 
- **Efficient Data Management**: Manages sorted data efficiently while maintaining balanced tree properties. 
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Supports efficient insertion and deletion operations with automatic balancing. 
- **Recursive Splitting**: Utilizes recursive splitting of arrays and places the split values in internal nodes, with leaf nodes storing actual values in sorted order. 
- **Rebuild Operation**: Implements a rebuild operation to maintain balance in the tree after deletions. 
- **Dynamic Tree Balancing**: Explores dynamic tree balancing techniques to ensure

## Learning Objectives 
- Implementing and working with multiway search trees. 
- Understanding recursive node splitting for dynamic tree balancing. 
- Managing sorted arrays within tree nodes and determining split points for navigation. 
- Gaining proficiency in memory management and pointer-based tree structures

## Applications 
Search trees, particularly the M-Tree, enable efficient data retrieval and modification in many real-world applications, such as database indexing, file systems, and memory management. By designing and implementing the M-Tree, this project reinforces core data structure concepts and helps understand how these structures are applied in systems like databases and memory hierarchies.
